# Book Outline: Viruses - From Molecular Biology to Pandemics

## Rationale
This book transforms the lecture transcripts into a cohesive textbook. The structure follows the original course's 8-lesson progression, as it builds logically from molecular foundations to viral structure, specific diseases, immunity, vaccines, and finally the relevant case study of COVID-19.
